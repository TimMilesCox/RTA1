#	Please copy this file .rta_net to your home directory	
#	and update the settings at the foot of this text
#	if you have more than one RTA1 in your local network[s]
#
#	RTA_ENET should be a network address in the range
#
#		172.29.7.8 to 172.29.7.62
#
#	RTA_WIFI should be a network address in the range
#
#		172.29.7.65 to 172.31.255.254
#
#	If there is only one RTA emulator in your network
#	then the defaults already set are available for immediate use
#
#	linux has different interface names for lo0, en0 and en1
#	typically lo, eth0 and eth1. Please edit the lines below
#
#	The defaults wired ethernet on en0 or eth0 and WiFi on en1
#	or eth1 are customary on platforms which have both
#
#	Certain slim-built platforms where you might emulate RTA1
#	don't have a a wired ethernet socket. WifI may then be
#	interface en0 or eth0. If so swap the values ENET and WIFI
#
#		export	WIFI=en0	# or eth0
#
#	Check what interface names you really have:
#
#		ifconfig -a
#

export RTA_ENET=172.29.7.8/26		# additional RTA1s make this 172.29.7.9  .. 172.29.7.62
export RTA_WIFI=172.29.7.66/12		# additional RTA1s make this 172.29.7.66 .. 172.31.255.254
export SLOOP=lo0
export ENET=en0
export WIFI=en1
