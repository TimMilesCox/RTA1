.	after stream and filestream operations
.	change stream control registers
.	to a useful default in their other r√¥le
.	as SIMD configuration registers
.	set for single operations (a SIMD array one operation deep)
.	without applications configuring anything

.	applications then always have a second set of accumulators
.	in addition to the regular accumulators:

.		[ a b mantissa2 mantissa3 8 9 10 11]

.	threads are started with the same defaults
