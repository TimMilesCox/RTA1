LAST_BYTE_READ	$equ	d$save3
BYTES		$equ	d$save
QUAD		$equ	8
TRIPLE		$equ	9
SIGNS		$equ	d$save1
SCALE_TRIPPED	$equ	d$save2	. these are the same register
SCALE		$equ	d$save2	. so negative scale is 1s complement


"$FINESSE"      $equ    1	. this isn't a register. It causes
				. the scale of floating numbers in integer range
				. to be adjusted in fixed point
				. instead of being finally adjusted in
				. floating point with possible roundings
				. when scannning character to float
