.	display treatment
.	add days before posix to posix days
.	divide by 400Y epoch days. 		quotient * 400 = 1st part of year
.	divide remainder by era 100Y days	quotient * 100 = 2nd part of year
.	divide remainder by era 4Y days		quotient *   4 = 3rd part of year
.	divide remainder by 365			quotient       = last part of year

.	remainder is day in year
.	if the remainder of dividing by 400 years of days < 366
.						it is a leap year
.						day in year is that remainder
	
.	if otherwise the remainder of dividing by 100 years of days < 365
.						it is not a leap year
.						day in year is that remainder

.	if otherwise the remainder of dividing by 4 years of days < 366
.						it is a leap year
.						day in year is that remainder

.	obviously break down day in year into [ 31 { 28 | 29  } 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31 ]
.
.	when you've done that,	the year results are OK being relative zero
.				the 1st century is supposed to have started year 1
.				the 2nd century is considered to have started "january" year 100
.				but the calculation squares around 1970 years to 1970
.				making 1 BC into year zero and a leap year
.				and 4 AD into the first leap year ever. Hoo. Ray.

.	either replace the month number with a name or add 1 to number months 1..12
.	add 1 to the day number, so you don't have goofy stuff like June 0th..29th
